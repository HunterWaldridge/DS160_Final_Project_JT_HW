# DS160_Final_Project_JT_HW


### Abstract 
##### For this project, the Avila data set was used. The data from this set was drawn from 800 images of the Avila Bible. An exploratory analysis was performed to clean and better understand the data set. The two machine learning models used in this project to predict the classes were K-Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree. Each model was running four times under four different experiment parameters. In this data set, the classes were twelve copyist who wrote pages of the Avila Bible.

### Introduction 
##### The classification target of the data set is the copyists. Before printers, individuals would have to copy pages of books. In our data set is trying to predict the copyists of the Avila Bible. Since each copyist had their own way of writing, our data set looks at ten features to help indicate which copyist is which. The copyists are not given names, but are identified with the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, W, X, and Y. The ten features used to make the predictions are intercolumn distance, upper margin, lower margin, exploitation, row number, modular ratio, interlinear spacing, weight, peak number, and modular ratio divided by interlinear spacing.
